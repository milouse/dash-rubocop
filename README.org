#+title: Convert RuboCop documentation to Dash

This repository contains a ruby script allowing one to convert the
RuboCop manual for a given tag to a [[https://kapeli.com/dash][Dash]] compatible docset.

* Dependencies

This script support modern rubies (> 2.5) and requires:

- kramdown
- kramdown-parser-gfm
- nokogiri
- rouge
- sqlite3

#+begin_src sh
$ gem install bundler
$ bundle install
#+end_src

* How to use it

Just call the script with a git tag reference:

#+begin_src sh
$ ruby convert_manual.rb <TAG>
#+end_src

For exemple:

#+begin_src sh
$ ruby convert_manual.rb v0.82.0
#+end_src

It will work with commit id or branch name too, even if it's not really
necessarily. Because of a small internal trick, it won't work with
branch, which name contains a `v`. However, you should always use tags.
